# Recent changes

Newest first. Keep the **newest 15** entries here; `python tools/archive_changes.py` moves the rest to
`docs/archive/CHANGES-YYYY-MM.md`. Stable facts belong in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, not here.

Entry format (heading must be exactly `## <version> — <YYYY-MM-DD> — <title>` so the script can parse it):

```
## 0.2.1 — 2026-09-24 — Short title
- **What:** user-visible change in one or two lines.
- **Where:** files / functions touched.
- **Notes:** invariants, gotchas, decisions, things deliberately NOT done — what the next agent must know.
```

Add new entries directly below this line.

## 0.36.0 — 2026-11-13 — PDF reports: a note's pictures in rows
- **What:** in both PDF reports (Sight's and the phone app's) a note's pictures — its frame / view
  with its caption, the other frames / views it was drawn on, its screenshots — sit side by side in
  rows, each whole, 92 pt high (three 16:9 frames to an A4 row), a small caption under each; a
  reply's pictures likewise at 70 pt, indented. The cover stays one big picture. A note's pictures
  now come right under its words, before its replies (as the phone's HTML report already did).
- **Where:** `app/review.py` `_pic_rows` (one `<table>` per row: PyMuPDF's Story does not wrap a
  table row, so the rows are packed here) used by `build_pdf`; `mobile/js/report.js` `toPdf` →
  `rows(list, x0, width, rowH)`.
- **Notes:** the HTML reports are unchanged (the browser lays them out). Checked by rendering both
  PDFs to pictures (a note with three frames and a portrait screenshot, a reply with two pictures).
  Review (fresh agent): results in the next entry if it finds anything.

## 0.35.5 — 2026-11-13 — Phone viewer: the incoming picture fades in as it slides
- **What:** in the full-screen viewer the picture coming in now also comes out of transparency
  (0 → 1) while it slides, as the outgoing one fades out — it no longer shows up fully opaque at
  once (what the user saw as "appears abruptly"; the 0.35.4 seek change stays).
- **Where:** `mobile/js/app.js` `viewer` → `show(no, slide)` (the incoming box's keyframes).
  Test: `viewerFade` checks both pictures are part-transparent mid-slide.

## 0.35.4 — 2026-11-13 — Phone viewer: the strip slide is smooth again (no seek on opening)
- **What:** since 0.35.0 a tap on a note's picture also moved the player to that frame before the
  viewer opened; on a phone the first swipes then stuttered and the next picture popped in
  instead of sliding. Back to 0.33's behaviour: the tap selects the note and opens the viewer, the
  player is left alone; Back puts it on the frame last looked at, as before.
- **Where:** `mobile/js/app.js` `openThread` (no `selectNote` / seek, only `R.curNote`).
- **Notes:** cause, as far as could be told without the device (headless Chromium slides fine
  either way): the seek's `settle` grabs and encodes a ≤ 1600 px frame on the main thread right
  under the first swipe, and the grabber's video competes with the player's decoder for the next
  picture (over FADE_WAIT, it comes in blank and pops). Do not seek the player while the viewer
  is opening.

## 0.35.3 — 2026-11-13 — Canvas: the fill row's "the line's colour" is back
- **What:** the Shapes row's fill colour row starts again with *the line's colour* (the default: a
  fill in the line's own colour, lighter), then the six colours — the way back once a colour was
  picked (the user's call, reversing 0.35.0).
- **Where:** `app/static/review-draw.js` `fillButton`. Test: `fill` (7 entries, back to null).

## 0.35.2 — 2026-11-13 — Phone: picked reviews swipe together; fixes to note selection
- **What:** (1) Home: a picked review swiped left / right slides with every other picked one; the
  bin / eye uncovered on any of them deletes (one confirm) / hides all the picked ones.
  (2) Fixes from the fresh-agent review of 0.35.0: a tap on a card or a picture while a new note
  or a reply is being written no longer moves the player or the selection (a text-only note went
  on the tapped note's frame; a reply's pencil drew on another note's frame); closing the viewer
  on another note of a picture review now moves the highlight (`showNote` repaints); a note's
  "first frame" is its own drawings' (`noteFrameList`), not its replies'; a marker step on the
  drawing canvas does not select the note behind it; a text selection made / dropped on a card
  is no tap; while writing over the player the hidden controls show again; the speaker's tooltip
  says "tap: full / mute"; the `select` test clicks and checks the same card.
- **Where:** `mobile/js/app.js` — `rowGestures` (`peers` / `placeAll`, `row._place`), the review
  row's `.sw` buttons, `selectNote`, the card's click, `showNote`, `jumpNote`, `paintSnd`;
  `mobile/index.html` (`.review.clean` rules `:not(.compose)`). Test: `swipeAll`.
- **Notes:** left as reviewed: with the controls hidden a mouse has no way to the panel but the
  round button (the swipe up is touch only). (The fill row's "the line's colour" is back in 0.35.3.)

## 0.35.1 — 2026-11-13 — Phone: the viewer's caption across the width, the pencil over it; no subtitle on home
- **What:** the full-screen viewer's caption (number, frame, words) spans the whole width at the
  foot and the pencil sits just over it, whatever the caption's height. The home screen's title
  has no "Reviews stay on this device" under it (the list's foot says it already).
- **Where:** `mobile/js/app.js` `viewer` (`.vfoot` holds the pencil and the caption; the picture
  boxes go in before it), `renderHome`; `mobile/index.html` (`.view .vfoot`, `.view .cap`).
  Test: `capPlace`.

## 0.35.0 — 2026-11-13 — Phone: selecting a note, controls hidden, mute on a tap
- **What:** (1) A tap on a note's card selects it (the accent frame) and puts the player on the
  first frame of its drawing; a tap on one of its pictures does the same, then opens it full
  screen; a marker step that lands on a note's frame selects it. The highlight no longer follows
  the playhead (that was the confusing part): notes on the frame shown get a lighter frame.
  (2) The header's second row has, at its left end, a button that hides every control; a round
  button in the top left brings them back; the gestures keep working. (3) A tap on the speaker
  mutes / gives full volume; a drag sets the volume from where it is. (4) Canvas: the fill row
  has only the six colours (no "the line's colour" entry; a fill follows the line until one is
  picked).
- **Where:** `mobile/js/app.js` — `paintCurrent` (`.cur` / `.here`), `selectNote`, the card's
  click, `openThread`, `jumpNote`; `setClean`, `.uib` / `.fab.showui` in `buildStage`, icons
  `hideui` / `showui`; the speaker's tap. `mobile/index.html` (`.note.here`, `.review.clean`).
  `app/static/review-draw.js` (`fillButton`). Tests: `select`, `clean`, `mute`, `fill`.
- **Notes:** the controls stay hidden while the review is open (`R.clean`, not kept). With the
  panel open the bar shows as usual. Review (fresh agent): fixes in 0.35.2.

## 0.34.0 — 2026-11-13 — Phone: loop / once button; the viewer's caption shows three lines of words
- **What:** (1) The transport has a button right of the sound: *once* (stops at the end, the
  default) or *loop*; a tap switches, kept on the device; the canvas' transport has it too.
  (2) The full-screen viewer's caption puts the note's / reply's words on their own line under the
  number and the frame, up to three lines; longer words scroll inside the caption (the picture is
  not covered).
- **Where:** `mobile/js/app.js` — `LOOP_KEY` / `loopOn` / `setLoop` / `paintLoop`, `T.loop` in
  `makeTransport`, `v.loop` in `buildStage`, icons `loop` / `once`; `viewer` (`.cap .tx`, its
  pointerdown / touchmove / wheel left to the words). `mobile/index.html` (`.tpi .loopb`, a
  ≤ 360 px layout without the "fps" word, `.view .cap` wraps, `span.tx`). Tests: `loop`,
  `capText` in `pwa_touch.cjs` / `test_pwa.py`.
- **Notes:** the words' scroll is the browser's own (touch-action pan-y on the scroll box; the
  viewer neither captures nor prevents those touches) — headless Chromium's synthetic touches do
  not scroll, so the test checks the box scrolls, is hit and is not prevented. One run of the
  PWA suite out of four ended with an error not seen again (not traced; the next three passed).

## 0.33.6 — 2026-11-13 — Canvas: the text box is a plain switch again
- **What:** the *Text* row's box button switches the box on / off as before; switched on, its
  colours show in the second row (no "no box" entry there — the user's call: off is the switch).
- **Where:** `app/static/review-draw.js` (the text row's button handler, `openSub`). Test:
  `textSub` (on → off hides the row; on again shows six colours).
- **Notes:** to change the box's colour later: tap it off and on again (the colours show), or pick
  it while the box is being switched on.

## 0.33.5 — 2026-11-13 — Canvas: filled shapes get their own fill colour
- **What:** on the drawing canvas (phone + HTML page) the Shapes row ends with *Fill colour*: a
  second row above it — the line's own colour (as before) or black, white, red, yellow, green,
  blue. A colour picked while an outlined shape is in hand switches to its filled kind (rectangle /
  rounded → filled rectangle, ellipse → filled ellipse). The button shows the fill.
- **Where:** `app/static/review-draw.js` — `pen.fill` (saved with the pen), `fillButton` /
  `fillIco` / `setFill`, `subRow` (the second row, now shared with the text's box / font rows),
  `begin` (fill colour / opacity), `recolour`. Tests: `fill` in `pwa_touch.cjs` / `test_pwa.py`
  (the Shapes row has 6 buttons now).
- **Notes:** a fill of its own colour is drawn at 0.6 opacity, the line's own at 0.3 (as before).
  The colour circle recolouring a selection changes a fill only when it was the line's colour (a
  fill picked on purpose stays). FORMAT.md is unchanged (`fill` was already its own field).

## 0.33.4 — 2026-11-13 — Canvas: a second row for the text's box colour and font
- **What:** on the drawing canvas (phone + HTML page) the *Text* row's box and font switches open
  a second row above it: the box's colour (black, white, red, yellow, green, blue; 0.33.6: no
  "no box" in it), and
  the five fonts each shown in itself. The box switch shows the box's colour. The outline stays a
  plain on / off switch (the user's choice: a colour row for it is not needed).
- **Where:** `app/static/review-draw.js` — `openSub` / `closeSub` (`.dfly.dsub`, closed with
  the row), `applyText(patch)` / `putText(d, patch)` (was one key), `TEXT0` + `bg` /
  `outlineColor`, `FONT_IDS`, `TEXT_COLORS`, `boxIco` / `outlineIco`, `styleOf` counts the
  colours. Tests: `textSub` in `pwa_touch.cjs` / `test_pwa.py`.
- **Notes:** a pick folds the second row, the text row stays. The box keeps its opacity (0.6 by
  default) whatever colour; the outline's colour is the pen's (`outlineColor`, black), not offered.

## 0.33.3 — 2026-11-13 — Sight: right-drag sizes a note's pictures
- **What:** in the review panel a right-drag up / down on the notes list makes the notes' square
  pictures bigger / smaller, the way a right-drag zooms the library grid's thumbnails; the size is
  kept with the settings. As many squares to a row as fit, stretched to fill it (default: four).
- **Where:** `app/static/annotate.js` — `bindThumbZoom` (on `.an-list`), `THUMB` / `noteThumb`,
  setting `sight.annotate.thumb` (via `writeJSON` → `host.putSetting`), CSS `.an-pics`
  (`repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(var(--an-thumb), 100%), 1fr))`).
- **Notes:** same rule as the grid (0.9 px of size per px dragged, up = bigger), 40–320 px; the
  squares grow in steps of whole columns (the row is always filled). A right click without a drag
  does nothing there (no menu in the panel). Checked with Playwright on a dev server.

## 0.33.2 — 2026-11-13 — Sight: a note's pictures as small squares, as on the phone
- **What:** in Sight's review panel a note's pictures (its frame / picture with the drawings, the
  other frames it was drawn on, its screenshots) and a reply's (its drawing, its pictures) are one
  grid of equal squares, four to a row, each cut to fill — no more full-width pictures.
- **Where:** `app/static/annotate.js` — `picGrid`, `renderPanel` / `repliesHtml` use it,
  `previewBox` (overlay `xMidYMid slice`, the box's inline aspect overridden in the grid), CSS
  `.an-pics`.
- **Notes:** clicks are unchanged (they key on `.an-nprev[data-pt]`, `img[data-shot]`,
  `img[data-rshot]`, not on the container). The squares cut the picture's sides off: a drawing
  near the edge of a wide frame may sit outside its square (a click on the note shows them all on
  the picture).
  Checked on a dev server with Playwright (a picture note with screenshots and a reply).

## 0.33.1 — 2026-11-12 — Phone report: replies' drawings on the reply's own pictures
- **What:** the phone's PDF / HTML report no longer burns a reply's drawing onto the note's frame
  (nor its extra frames, nor a picture note's picture): each reply that drew gets its own pictures
  — every frame it drew on, the note's own frame too (a picture review: the picture) — with only
  its drawings, as the app shows them since 0.33.0.
- **Where:** `mobile/js/report.js` `gatherReport` (`noteOnly`, the reply loop). Test: the video
  HTML report has two pictures (the note's frame, the reply's) — `pwa_e2e.cjs` / `test_pwa.py`.
- **Notes:** the cover of a picture review still shows every drawing. Sight's own PDF / HTML
  report is unchanged: it has no reply pictures, so it still shows replies' drawings on the note's
  frame (dropping them there would lose them).

## 0.33.0 — 2026-11-12 — Phone: strip viewer, square note pictures, filters by swipe, text switches, home selection and moves between groups
- **What:** (1) Note viewer: a swipe sends the picture on the way it went, fading out, and the
  next follows it in like a strip (sideways = the note's pictures, up / down = notes). (2) Notes
  list: a swipe left / right steps the status filter. (3) A note's / reply's pictures are one grid
  of equal squares, cut to fill (Settings → *Pictures in a row*, 3–6, default 4). (4) Bug: a
  reply's drawing showed on the note's own picture — now only on the reply's. (5) Transport:
  "25 fps", the rate and the speaker a little apart from the timecode. (6) The turn-90° button is
  gone everywhere (phone header, the canvas on phone + HTML page, Sight's lightbox — Shift+R stays
  there); the header's view icons sit in the middle, *Fit* at the right end. (7) Canvas: the slot
  rows have the bars' see-through look; the *Text* slot has switches — bold, italic, underline,
  box, outline, alignment, font. (8) Home: a tap on a review picks it (tick), its picture opens it;
  the bar at the foot moves (*Move to…*: a group / a new group / out), hides or deletes the picked
  ones; any review — also one in a group — dropped onto another group's header or member moves
  there (picked ones go along); a group's row counts every state; *Picture…* gives a group one of
  its reviews' pictures / cached frames or a colour. (9) Bug: right after a swipe back from a
  review, the next tap on a review did not open it — home taps now act on pointerup.
- **Where:** `mobile/js/app.js` — `viewer` (`show(no, slide)`, `navigate`), `FILTERS` /
  `stepFilter` / `bindPanelPull`, `picBox` (overlay `cover` = slice), `shotThumbs(…, into)`,
  `noteCard` / `replyEntry` (`.pics`), `THUMBS` / `setThumbs`, `drawingsOn` (no reply rows for
  the note), `paintRate` (`<small>fps`), `viewOf` (rot 0), `buildStage` (`.fitb`); home:
  `homeSel` / `toggleSel` / `paintSelBar`, `moveInto` / `groupKeys` / `takeOut` / `moveMenu`,
  `groupThumbSheet`, `groupHead`, `rowGestures` (`tapAct`, `st.targets`), `deleteReviews`,
  `reviewNames`. `mobile/index.html` (`.pics`, `.selbar`, `.gcols` / `.gpics`, `.th.tint`, `.row.sel`,
  `.th.four` fixed: its pictures were zero-sized). `app/static/review-draw.js` (`TEXT_OPTS`,
  `textOpt` / `putText` / `paintTextFly` / `styleOf`, `.dfly.rd-panel`, turn button removed,
  `afterView`). `app/review.py` (stored turn dropped), `app/static/index.html` (`#turnBtn` gone).
  Tests: `pwa_touch.cjs` / `test_pwa.py` (`filterSwipe`, `pics`, `replyOffNote`, `viewerFade`
  strip, `textFly`, `reopen`, `between`, `groupSum`, `pick`, `groupPic`), `pwa_e2e.cjs` opens
  reviews by their picture.
- **Notes:** a picked review stays picked across renders until opened / moved / hidden / deleted
  (pruned when gone). Groups dissolve under two members at the next render, as before (`tidyGroups`).
  The group picture is stored in the group (localStorage, a ≤ 200 px data URL). The phone and the
  HTML page drop a quarter turn stored by an older version (mirror kept); a two-finger turn is
  still the view's own. A new text's outline is 6 % of its size. (The phone report: 0.33.1.)
- **Review (fresh agents):** viewer / notes / turn — no bugs; fixed: the report of an empty
  picture grid (hidden when nothing loads), the view icons jumping when *Fit* came and went, a
  test selector that could hit an attached picture. Canvas text — no bugs; fixed: a switch during
  a selection hold lost its change (stopAdj first), the field lost the focus to the row's buttons
  (keyboard bouncing; a resize folded the row), the row not repainted after undo, the field's
  preview of centred / right text, outline and box colour, Impact not in the font cycle, test
  pen state. Home — fixed: a review dragged while *not* picked took every picked one along; a
  touch that stopped a fling picked / opened a review (a scroll within 150 ms or the page moved:
  no tap); the click a pointerup-tap ends with could land on the selection bar it just brought up
  (*Hide* at once) — eaten once, document-wide (`ghostUntil`, armed only by a pointer tap, not a
  keyboard click); new groups / *Move to…* use the list's order, not the tap order; *Take out* of
  several kept their order; an empty *Move to…* sheet (a toast now); a review's own *Move to…*
  cleared an unrelated selection; the group-picture sheet decoded every cached 1600 px frame
  (≤ 12 small previews per review now, one at a time); a full localStorage lost group changes
  silently (toast); a failed delete skipped the re-render. Left: the update banner covers the
  selection bar while it shows; picked reviews inside a closed group still count.
